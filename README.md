# Emergency-Bot

Helps to stay connected with someone who needed you in their worst time.

Reason behind the idea?

Most of us, when we enter in to the office we keep our mobile devices in silent mode and will forget about the calls and whatsapp messages, most of the times we didnt take the calls which needed to be responded immediately. So whats in that case....

for example which is my story...

Story-1)

My colleague called me twelve times to unlock his locked account to which i didnt respond, he has taken casual leave on that day just because of me.

Story-2)

A friend of mine waiting for me outside the office to meet me, It was 2 years we didnt meet, he called me and messaged me to which i didnt give a reply because "The Phone is in silent mode".

To encounter these type of situations, Creating Emergency-Bot.
